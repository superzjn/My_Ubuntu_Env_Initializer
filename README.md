# Ubuntu DesktopEnv Setup
This project is to use Ansible to setup a personal use Ubuntu desktop environment. So that you dont need to worry about messing up your environment again! :)


## Packer Part
- The base code is from https://github.com/boxcutter
- I've modified it to make it working for ubuntu 18.04.2 server version
- Desktop version is not working due to installer bug. 
    - Cannot find initrd=/install/initrd.gz
    - Hang at "Waiting for SSH to be available..."

## Ansible Part
### Installation List (ToDO)
